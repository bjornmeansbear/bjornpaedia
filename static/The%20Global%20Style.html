Today it is taken for granted that graphic designers have a cultural role to play. We won that battle, we have our autonomy. But is this how we want to use it? Replicating art world practices, and recycling old styles for each other? Is being an institutional servant somehow better than being a commercial one? Better for who?"</p><p>"The Global Style, Modernist Typography after Postmodernism" by Mr. Keedy
