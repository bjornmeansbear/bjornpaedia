<p>We are packed. I am tired. There are never enough hours to do everything. Do I just have too many things I want to do? How can I be better at not "wasting" time – meaning doing things that are of no benefit to myself!?</p><p>Tomorrow we drive to Maine. How am I planning to offset this trip? Can I take trips anymore if I want to do something about climte change? How can I better use the time and energy? how can we do something more with our yard and house and lives?</p><p>It was way easier to design a poster everyday than to try and write something personally useful everyday.</p><p>So, if I start collecting these ideas, what does one do with them? do I need something to do? why can't I just accept getting them down, getting things clarified for myself, letting it direct me better? How can this be all things: journal and personal therapy and knowledge exploration and idea working out space and essay generator!? and thats just what it is. If it is seen or not, if I do smoething or not, the things are here, theyre down, theyre connected!</p><p>In 6 hours we go to maine. Not tomorrow.</p><p>What is in Maine? time? space? calm? peace? a change? what am I seeking that I hope to find there we're unable to find or do here?</p><p>Go to bed.</p><p>That needs to be my new mantra above all else. Go to bed. Not more writing, more sustainabilitizing, but more sleeping.</p>
