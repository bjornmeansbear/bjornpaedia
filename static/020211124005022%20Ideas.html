If we are entering a time in human and planetary history where everything human constructed needs redesigning on a massive scale, well then we need more people in more places and with more backgrounds to have access to useful designing software, systems, ideas, etc. The <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#F%2FLOS">F/LOS</a> model allows for this; its baked in. Share and share alike. Better access to tools — at least theoretically.</p><p>The linux ecosystem unlocks computers that are otherwise "too old" or "too slow" or whatever else: Is it fair that because mac updated something, Adobe updated something, and now the old computer I still choose (or have to) use is "too old" and now no longer supported? If the computer works fine; then lets use it! Installing something from the linux world I have found can give real life back to an older machine allowing one to give their computer(s) longer lives; replacing them less often; and thus greatly reducing one’s footprint; and just allows people that maybe can't afford (or just don't want) to upgrade physical hardware the ability to just keep on trucking...</p><p>what else???</p>
