<p><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Graphic%20Design">Graphic Design</a> that is somehow sustainable. Graphic Design in the service of <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#the%20welfare%20of%20all%20life">the welfare of all life</a>. Graphic Design that helps life to flourish.</p><p>In my perfect vision for the future, this is what regular, status quo, graphic design just becomes... so when you said <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Graphic%20Design">Graphic Design</a> you would mean things that specifically are <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="#Sustainable">Sustainable</a> — not what we mean now, where the sustainable is an extra adjective and so implies that you must do more or do something different...</p><p>If sustainable graphic design is design in service of what we want to sustain — how do you decide what's worth sustaining? (if we want to sustain the status quo, then that is what sustainable graphic design is — hmmm!?).</p><p>Designer <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Bruce%20Mau">Bruce Mau</a> has a similar description for the goals of <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Massive%20Change">Massive Change</a>: “Our project is the welfare of all life as a practical objective.”</p><p>So, this is what we'll use as our definition of Sustainable Graphic Design: sustainable graphic design is “graphic design in support of all life flourishing,” or, “graphic design for the welfare of all life.”</p>
