Well, it is a "<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="#digital%20garden">digital garden</a>" to use the popular current term. Its sort of a <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="#ZettleKasten">ZettleKasten</a>. It is mostly a place where questions are posed, though almost never answered.
