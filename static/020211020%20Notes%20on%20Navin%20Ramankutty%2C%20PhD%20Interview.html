<p>How to Feed the World and Shrink our climate footprint</p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="#Navin%20Ramankutty">Navin Ramankutty</a></p><p>How does the food system need to change to help solve our environmental problems!?</p><p>land use</p><p>there isn't just one thing that causes climate change.</p><p>it is everything, driving, heating our buildings</p><p>none of it is deliberate</p><p>the solutions too are numerous, there isn't a single thing to do.</p><p>land use, energy, transportation... </p><p>social side of things are moving much faster. This is where we need to make a lot of ground.</p><p>cost of renewables is dropping</p><p>vegans and vegetarianism is increasing. this is all collectively positive.</p><p>food system is about 25% of carbon production</p><ul><li>stop deforestation for commodity food (soy and palm oil) most of this goes to industrial purposes or animal feed</li><li>methane from livestock, global nitrogen cycle... ?</li><li>Nitrous oxide emissions &gt; from fertilizing! 1/2 of all nitrogen use is for fertilizing. So, permaculture, organics... </li></ul><p>70% of deforestation is in 2 countries: brazil and indonesia. This is not for "food" this is for global commodities...</p><p>source crops from places that are not deforesting lands!? &gt; can an individual do something about this?</p><p>NOX is a horrible GHG. (≈11:25) accounts for 3x the effects of GHG heating that flying does... </p><p>Nitrates are also bad in the water systems</p><p>managing nitrogen is also a climate problem.</p><p>"red sky in the morning" when we solve the climate, we have a nitrogen problem next!</p><p>cumulative impact of human society as a whole... solving the climate problem, the energy problem, whatever without thinking of our larger societal metabolism can have pitfalls!?</p><p>can we tie crop insurance to better environmental policy? </p><p>biological insurance?</p><p>diversification</p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="#Nathan%20Mueller">Nathan Mueller</a> nitrogen cycle study?</p><p>we always want to do new things, but we can also focus on doing everything we do more efficiently... maybe not as sexy, but potentially more immediate?</p><p>do we need to produce all this food!?</p><p>food waste and shifting diets are the most important things in the food systems to make some action...</p><p>improving efficiency in food system is important but its the third, least useful lever to pull.</p><ol><li>reduce food waste</li><li>shift diet to less or no meat</li><li>use current land, etc. more efficiently</li></ol><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="#Rattan%20Lal">Rattan Lal</a></p><p>Degraded land takes in a lot of carbon at first, but then there is a sort of a ramp down, and then at a certain point there isn't more carbon sequestration into the soil?</p><p>30% of our emissions are really hard to abate – flying, trucking... some are easy, what are the easiest industrial and energy sources we can get rid of!?</p><p>we can't assure that things are sequestered permanently... trees, farm land, etc. are all transitory!?</p><p>tactic: just file lawsuits against new coal, etc. fossil power plants, after stalling them renewables end up cheaper and you don't have to worry!? </p>
