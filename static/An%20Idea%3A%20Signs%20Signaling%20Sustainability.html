<p>Instead of what does sustainable graphic design look like then, a more important question is what values underpin your sustainable graphic design? Or, what values does your sustainable graphic design signal out to the world?</p><p>How does your design makes tangible, makes understandable, something about sustainability?</p><p>This is doable no matter the project; no matter the prompt. There are myriad aspects of climate change and sustainability one might signal. Each even in their tiniest part we can think of as contributing to "all life flourishing."</p><p>This is another opportunity to find the context for which "beauty" exists in a design without resorting to superficial, external styling. We can focus on values or ethics in the unique contexts of each new project.</p><h3 class="">Amager Bakke Vapor Ring</h3><p>A concept that was never made due to some weird problems; but that sent me down this direction: The Copenhagen waste to energy plant is so clean its exhaust stack puffs only CO2 and water vapor. (Its also a public ski hill and hiking mountain) Upon capturing 1 ton of CO2, exhausts it as a smoke ring. Help you visualize this otherwise intangible aspect of sustainability!? (Bjarke Ingels Group)</p><p>(FACT CHECK NOTES FROM ISABEL!?)</p><p>Images? what else?</p><h3 class="">Reverberation Crosswalks</h3><p>Reverberation Crosswalks are fun, brightly colored crosswalks. Just paint on cement and asphalt they still signal a sustainable vector forward. The neighborhood around this intersection is now more walkable. You can't not notice the crosswalks. They contribute to life flourishing in the city. This concept is cheap; fast; easily replicated; can be customized for region, culture, available materials, etc. (Graham Coreil Allen)
</p><h3 class="">solar.lowtechmagazine.com</h3><p>Low Tech Magazine's solar powered website signals how we might visualize energy usage; how we might enable new systems of powering our tools; questions if we really need constant connection; and how aesthetic choices correlate to physical resources even in the digital sphere. (Kris De Decker &amp; Marie Otsuka)
</p><h3 class="">DC High Water Mark Project</h3><p>The DC water mark project visualizes increased flooding and water level rise. The water level rings articulate "oh shit, this place might be underwater pretty frequently given our current projected future!" By signaling this, perhaps we can act accordingly and redirect our present towards a future where that is no longer true. Without _seeing_ your house or office or favorite park area submerged, even symbolically, you cannot envision an alternative.
