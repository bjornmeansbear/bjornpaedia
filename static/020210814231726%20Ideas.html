<p>How am I going to do all the things I want to do? How do I make my house carbon negative? how do I renovate my basement and kitchen and install minisplits and go solar and whatever else? How do I even finish my yard and playspace projects!? those are things that should take just a few days at best...</p><p>Okay, so we need to save money. We need to save time. We need to stop goofing around. we need to stop watching shows??? How do I not waste time during the day?</p>
