<p>Basically, you run the exhaust off a fossil fuel power plant into a <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="#greenhouse">greenhouse</a>. The <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#CO2">CO2</a> is then turned into growing things. Each season part of grown material is turned into <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#BioChar">BioChar</a> to fertilize the greenhouse and is then part of a <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#drawdown">carbon sequestering</a> plan?</p><p>What else can you use the outputs for? This is a winding down <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="#fossil%20fuels">fossil fuels</a> plan, not a permanent plan — though maybe in a few cases where you can't remove a methane plant or something because we need to use up the methane somehow from a landfill or animal waste facility?</p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Plants%20grow%20faster%20in%20richer%20CO2%20environments">Plants grow faster in richer CO2 environments</a>
