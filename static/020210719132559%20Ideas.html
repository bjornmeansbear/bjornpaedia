<p>So, maybe a way to provide some more structure to this site is to try and actually write bits and pieces of an essay? can I pick apart what I did for my talk at University of Nebraska? how about explaining the projects that I explained to them? what else might be good...</p><p>What have I already written about I can try to update? What can I recombine or revise? How much have my thougts changed? improved? become more complex?
