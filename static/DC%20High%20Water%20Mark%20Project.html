<p>The DC water mark project visualizes increased flooding and water level rise. The water level rings articulate "oh shit, this place might be underwater pretty frequently given our current projected future!"

Without _seeing_ your house or office or favorite park area submerged, even symbolically, you cannot envision an alternative.
