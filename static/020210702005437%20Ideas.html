<p><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#John%20Ehrenfeld">John Ehrenfeld</a> states in the book <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Flourishing">Flourishing</a> “<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#The%20key%20to%20doing%20something%20about%20sustainability%20is%20that%20you%20first%20have%20to%20say%20what%20you%20want%20to%20sustain.">The key to doing something about sustainability is that you first have to say what you want to sustain.</a>” Ehrenfeld wants to sustain that “<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#all%20humans%20and%20other%20life%20should%20flourish">all humans and other life should flourish</a>” (pg 23). Using Ehrenfeld’s thinking, Sustainable Graphic Design is design made for clients that believe all life should flourish, design made to promote messages about sustainability-as-flourishing, and design made with materials and processes that promote and sustain the state of flourishing too.</p><p>Graphic designers are form makers. Sustainable graphic designers must make formal decisions. How does the sustainable designer concern themselves with the forms and aesthetics of a solution? Are there visual choices that are more sustainable? What form says “I believe that humans and all life should flourish?” Are aesthetics as they relate to sustainability even important?</p><p>≠≠≠≠≠≠≠≠≠≠≠≠≠≠≠≠≠≠≠≠</p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#What%20do%20you%20want%20to%20sustain%3F">What do you want to sustain?</a></p><p>How does this question influence one's designing? are there materials that then one can't use? how about power sources?
