<p>For something like <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Learning%20Design%20for%20Sustainability">Learning Design for Sustainability</a>, <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Scott%20Boylston">Scott Boylston</a> doesn't actually "know more" than me â€” what's my problem; why can't I figure out how to do something with this knowledge? Classes? books? Projects? what is holding me back, what is keeping me from DOING. Am I afraid that I don't actually know what I am talking about? how does one get over that fear? how do I really learn or prove to myself that I've learned what I need to know then?</p><p>This isn't a new problem, this has ALWAYS been my problem!?</p>
