</p><h2 class="">Sustainable Graphic Design is Different</h2><p>All life flourishing is not the traditional goal of business, culture, and design. <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Sustainable%20Graphic%20Design">Sustainable Graphic Design</a> defined this way is different than "regular" cultural production.</p><p>Throughout western art and design history new or “different” thinking and tools correlate with new or different aesthetic outcomes.</p><p>Sustainability brings with it all manner of new technologies, new social structures, new tools. Should Sustainable graphic design then carry with it additional new forms and aesthetics?</p><h2 class="">An example: Selecting a font</h2><p>Does a font’s appearance matter as much as the energy and material and social ills it saves? Is selecting a font that uses minimal ink the best way to select a font? Would a font that is condensed, that uses up less space (saving paper over a print run; exposure to chemicals to the printer) be better? Can we combine the these? The thinest, most condensed, lightest ink coverage font is the most sustainable? This can easily be taken absurd lengths.</p><p>This is useful for critiquing design choices; it tackles outcomes from a resource perspective; can show a different "visual languages;" but does it embrace “the welfare of all life?”</p><h2 class="">Sustainable Graphic Design looks Ideological &amp; Critical?</h2><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Anthony%20Dunne">Anthony Dunne</a> and <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Fiona%20Raby">Fiona Raby</a> write in their 2001 book <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="#Design%20Noir%3A%20The%20Secret%20Life%20of%20Objects">Design Noir: The Secret Life of Objects</a> that “<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="#all%20design%20is%20ideological">all design is ideological</a>, the design process is informed by values based on a specific world view.” With “the welfare of all life” as our world view, how does that shift what and how we graphic design?</p><p>Anthony Dunne and Fiona Raby are proponents of “<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Critical%20Design">Critical Design</a>,” design that “provides a critique of the prevailing situation through designs that embody alternative social, cultural, technical, or economic values.”</p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="#Sustainable%20graphic%20design">Sustainable graphic design</a> is not just design that helps people and our planet, but design that is also critical of existing social, cultural, technical, AND economic structures; since many of these things are harming all life, not helping them to flourish.</p><h2 class="">Example: Green Acres</h2><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="#Green%20Acres%3A%20Artists%20Farming%20Fields%2C%20Greenhouses%2C%20and%20Abandoned%20Lots">Green Acres: Artists Farming Fields, Greenhouses, and Abandoned Lots</a> was a book I worked on with my friend and curator <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Sue%20Spaid">Sue Spaid</a>, for the Contemporary Art Center in Cincinnati, OH. <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Green%20Acres">Green Acres</a> featured artists using farming as their art practice.</p><p>The goal: make the resultant book "sustainable."

A transubstantiation of our individual ideals in a material medium.” This would then seem that however our ideals are materialized into graphic design yields “beautiful” graphic design. Botton specifically mentions "values critical to our flourishing." If we merge Botton's idea with our "all life flourishing" focused graphic design then sustainable design IS beautiful design. This doesn't imply a style or aesthetic, but instead a shared set of values. We get other criteria to help judge the goodness of a design, not purely formal, but the content, the context.</p><p>Sustainable designers must see the non-sustainable as the less than beautiful.

If you design for the welfare of all life, it doesn't matter what the design looks like, the design will be beautiful!?
</p><h2 class="">An Idea: Signs Signaling Sustainability</h2><p>Instead of what does sustainable graphic design look like then, a more important question is what values underpin your sustainable graphic design? Or, what values does your sustainable graphic design signal out to the world?</p><p>How does your design makes tangible, makes understandable, something about sustainability?</p><p>This is doable no matter the project; no matter the prompt. There are myriad aspects of climate change and sustainability one might signal. Each even in their tiniest part we can think of as contributing to "all life flourishing."</p><p>This is another opportunity to find the context for which "beauty" exists in a design without resorting to superficial, external styling. We can focus on values or ethics in the unique contexts of each new project.</p><h3 class="">Amager Bakke Vapor Ring</h3><p>A concept that was never made due to some weird problems; but that sent me down this direction: The Copenhagen waste to energy plant is so clean its exhaust stack puffs only CO2 and water vapor.

The water level rings articulate "oh shit, this place might be underwater pretty frequently given our current projected future!"

</p><h2 class="">Conclusion</h2><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>“There is a central quality which is the root criterion of life and spirit in a man, a town, a building, or a wilderness. This quality is objective and precise, but it cannot be named. It is never twice the same, because it always takes its shape from the particular place in which it occurs.”</p><p>— Christopher Alexander
</p></blockquote><p>The qualities that do promote the welfare of all life are, like the quality without a name Alexander presents, ineffable. And like the quality without a name, the aesthetics that correspond with this — the graphic design visuals that might show the welfare of all life — shift and change with different contexts. A wild garden, a biodegradable book, a thriving farmers market.</p><p>In prepping this lecture I was looking for the thread that connected my works together. That thread I thought was: what does sustainable graphic design look like? Everything I make continues to be an attempt at providing more answers to this.</p><p>But, I used to be hung up on the visual aesthetics. I wanted sustainable things to LOOK DIFFERENT to have their own aesthetic… but what I've learned is that the way sustainable graphic design looks isn't as important as the values underpinning the designs themselves. Anything that helps promote the flourishing of nature’s interconnected systems will look "correct" formally. That doesn’t require a (externally decided) particular style, material, or typeface.
</p><h2 class="">Example: MICA Grad Zine</h2><p>This is an interim piece for the MICA graduate admissions office. Visually the goal was to convey the diversity of graduate programs, as well as some of the current chaos of our present. Different graduate directors were trying to convey the values of their programs, could the visuals contribute to that. AND, there was an ask for the piece to embrace "sustainability."</p><p>So, the design decisions are all spurred by those constraints. Free, open, accessible culture is an important value of mine, and that makes its way into this via the imagery selected and the open source fonts. This also gave me ways to find "art historically" relevant images, and repurpose them to my meaning making.</p><p>The printing solution was designed to minimize printing waste — the front and back of this "poster" are printed all as one plate, so the press sheet goes through the press once, then is flipped over, and goes through the press again, voila. This means front and back of the pages were able to all be printed with one plate per color instead of two or more… All of these "values" intermingled here together, do they add up to a sustainable design? a beautiful design?</p><h2 class="">A Final Example: Ecovention Europe</h2><p>Fast forward from <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Green%20Acres">Green Acres</a>. <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Sue%20Spaid">Sue Spaid</a>, now living in Belgium, has a new exhibition: <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Ecovention%20Europe">Ecovention Europe</a>, ecologically inventive artists working in Europe, and there is another book.</p><p>In the interim since <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Green%20Acres">Green Acres</a>, I heard designer <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="#Sara%20de%20Bondt">Sara de Bondt</a> discuss the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="#Radical%20Nature">Radical Nature</a> catalog designed for the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="#Barbican">Barbican</a> in London. De Bondt's studio wrote a sustainable printing manifesto as part of the research for the catalog's production.</p><p>De Bondt's "manifesto" reminded me about constraints for framing design decisions: How might I re-examine the design choices of _Green Acres_ through new constraints? Could I improve the sustainability (and the sustainable aesthetics) for _Ecovention Europe_?</p><p>One of the items in De Bondt's printing manifesto is "use less ink." This meant selecting colors more carefully. The palette of _Ecovention Europe_ uses no color that adds up to more that 100% ink coverage. (_Ecovention Europe_ uses CMYK: and color palette swatches start at 100% pure C, M, Y, or K, and then are mixed in equal percentages to keep 100% or less total coverage: 50% + 50%; 33% + 33% + 33%; etc.). This resulted in a color palette that was fairly special for this book. Reducing ink also led to a graphic solution, bitmapped city aerial photos as the decorative section markers. The appearance of a filled area is kept, but less ink is used comparatively.</p><p>Text columns in _Green Acres_ ended at full paragraphs breaks to make editing easier. This gave a formally-nice rhythm to text columns, but it was an inefficient use of space. With _Ecovention Europe_, I reduced this space by running all the text the full column heights. This had the secondary benefit of minimizing superfluous decoration: In _Green Acres_, superficial decorative elements filled those blanks left by text columns ending mid-page.</p><p>I even tried to reduce decision making through reuse. The grid for _Green Acres_ had a lot of conceptual reasoning invested into it, and so I reused the page templates, type choices, grid setup, etc.</p><p>As a conceptual exercise, this was great. But, did it make much of a difference? How could this be done differently and improved upon again next time? Is there an alternative to making this book at all? (Should this exist? I didn’t ask that question before we began!)
