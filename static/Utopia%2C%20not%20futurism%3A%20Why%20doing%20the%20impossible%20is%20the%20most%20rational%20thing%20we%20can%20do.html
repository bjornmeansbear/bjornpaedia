<p>This 1978 speech by <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Murray%20Bookchin">Murray Bookchin</a> is strikingly relevant today</p><p>On August 24, 1978, Murray Bookchin gave a lecture at the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Toward%20Tomorrow%20Fair">Toward Tomorrow Fair</a> in Amherst, Massachusetts. Also speaking at that year’s gathering were several prominent thinkers, including <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#R.%20Buckminster%20Fuller">R. Buckminster Fuller</a> and <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="#Ralph%20Nader">Ralph Nader</a>. In his speech, Bookchin argues against the ideology of futurism and for ecological utopianism. In the Q&amp;A session, he points out that he is not against technology itself, he is against technocracy, and he also describes, in detail, his political vision for the future.</p><p>The speech is surprisingly relevant in today’s context: it’s as if he predicted the rise of fascist ideology and lifeboat ethics in the 21st century, and it feels like a direct rebuttal of Elon Musk-esque technocratic futurism on both the right and the left.</p><p>Because his speech is so applicable today, we decided to republish it here, making it accessible to a wider audience. It has been transcribed and edited lightly for flow, brevity, and grammar, and we have divided it into sub-sections for ease of reading.
