<p>I am eating cherry pie. It is good. I am supposed to be thinking of clever things to say about the jones falls. Why is that so hard?</p><p>Visits with friends. Visits with family. These things are so strange, so foreign seeming.</p><p>I keep missing a lot. Appointments, scheduled meetings, deadlines. I was pretty bad at this stuff before; but the way things still are turning out? its just enhanced all my problems with focus and time management and paying attention to what day or time it is.</p><p>What else can I do or write about? I am at a loss today. I will go through some missing things and fill in and connect.
