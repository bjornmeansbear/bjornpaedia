A healthy correction to critiques of the past century. Design is everywhere.</p><p>NOTES:</p><p>It is not of the slightest use for us to ask 'what is good design?' until we can answer the question 'what <em>is</em> design?' (pg 11, ¶4, L4)</p><p>The main difference between art and design is that the designer has limits set upon their freedom of choice (pg 11, ¶5) – FUNCTION carries with it LIMITATIONS or CONSTRAINTS</p><p>Function is a fantasy (pg 12, ¶1, L4); and thus so is FORM FOLLOWS FUNCTION</p><p>What function does this form serve???</p><p>Bottom of PG12:</p><ul><li>how do you determine what the thing you are designing has "got to do"?</li><li>does the information you have gained govern the design and determine its form or merely guide it?</li><li>what does purely functional mean?</li></ul><p>Whenever humans design and make a useful thing they invariably expend a good deal of unnecessary and easily avoidable work on it which contributes nothing to its usefulness. (pg13, ¶2, L2) &amp;! All useful devices have got to do a lot of other useless things which no one wants them to do (who wants a car to get hot, tires to wear out, etc.) (pg13, ¶3, L2)</p><p>unconscious motive for doing so much useless work is that if cannot make things work properly we can at least make them look presentable (pg13, ¶4, L5)
