A transubstantiation of our individual ideals in a material medium.” This would then seem that however our ideals are materialized into graphic design yields “beautiful” graphic design. Botton specifically mentions "values critical to our flourishing." If we merge Botton's idea with our "all life flourishing" focused graphic design then sustainable design IS beautiful design. This doesn't imply a style or aesthetic, but instead a shared set of values. We get other criteria to help judge the goodness of a design, not purely formal, but the content, the context.</p><p>Sustainable designers must see the non-sustainable as the less than beautiful. If your design doesn't account for the welfare of all life, whatever the external aesthetics that wrap it, your design is ugly. <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="#Edwin%20Datschefksi">Edwin Datschefksi</a> calls this “<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="#the%20hidden%20ugliness%20of%20traditional%20products">the hidden ugliness of traditional products</a>.” Basically, the non-sustainable is (&amp; can only be) ugly.</p><p>So: A design is both sustainable AND beautiful when its form declares that humans and all other life should flourish.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Beauty is in the eye of the beholder </p><p>— Margaret Wolfe Hungerford, Molly Bawn, 1878
