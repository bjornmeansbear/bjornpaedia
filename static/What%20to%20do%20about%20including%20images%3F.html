<p>Should images be their own tiddlers that are then transcluded? are images additional fields? Is there a difference between when an image is meta-data versus when the image IS the data?</p><p>For instance:</p><ul><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#The%20Sustainabilitist%20Principles">The Sustainabilitist Principles</a> &gt; is the tiddler the explanation and then images of the project are their own separate tiddler(s) transcluded!?</li></ul>
