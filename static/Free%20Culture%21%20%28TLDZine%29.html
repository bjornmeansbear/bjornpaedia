<p>What is <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Free%20Culture">Free Culture</a>?</p><p>When I am talking about free culture, I am talking about a) cultural production — producing the elements that help define and articulate and spread culture; and b) cultural production that is "free" for anyone to use, build upon, etc. This is <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Free%20Means%20Freedom">free as in freedom</a> culture. </p><p>The history of cultural works is building upon, remixing, copying, reusing, repurposing… it is cultural stuff that everyone owns... (Do I need to cite something here? reference something? is my conjecture fine?)</p><p>In our present we find ourselves increasingly constrained. Both from how we are allowed to use other's outputs, as well as in the tools and delivery mechanisms themselves — increasingly all of this is less free, more closed, more proprietary, more controlled.</p><p>±±±±±±±±±±±±±</p><p>Reference searches: </p><ul><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="http://www.thevariationlab.com/cultural-production#:~:text=In%20this%20sense%2C%20cultural%20production%20can%20be%20understood,means%20as%20a%20form%20of%20redefinition%20and%20research" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">http://www.thevariationlab.com/cultural-production#:~:text=In%20this%20sense%2C%20cultural%20production%20can%20be%20understood,means%20as%20a%20form%20of%20redefinition%20and%20research</a>.</li><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095652897" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095652897</a></li><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.p-art-icipate.net/cultural-production-in-theory-and-practice/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.p-art-icipate.net/cultural-production-in-theory-and-practice/</a></li><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture</a></li><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://carla.umn.edu/culture/definitions.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://carla.umn.edu/culture/definitions.html</a></li><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="http://people.tamu.edu/~i-choudhury/culture.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">http://people.tamu.edu/~i-choudhury/culture.html</a></li><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.peacecorps.gov/educators/resources/defining-culture/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.peacecorps.gov/educators/resources/defining-culture/</a></li><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://courses.lumenlearning.com/culturalanthropology/chapter/what-is-culture/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://courses.lumenlearning.com/culturalanthropology/chapter/what-is-culture/</a></li></ul>
