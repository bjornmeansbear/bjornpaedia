<p>Fast forward from <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Green%20Acres">Green Acres</a>. <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Sue%20Spaid">Sue Spaid</a>, now living in Belgium, has a new exhibition: <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Ecovention%20Europe">Ecovention Europe</a>, ecologically inventive artists working in Europe, and there is another book.</p><p>In the interim since <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Green%20Acres">Green Acres</a>, I heard designer <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="#Sara%20de%20Bondt">Sara de Bondt</a> discuss the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="#Radical%20Nature">Radical Nature</a> catalog designed for the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="#Barbican">Barbican</a> in London. De Bondt's studio wrote a sustainable printing manifesto as part of the research for the catalog's production.</p><p>De Bondt's "manifesto" reminded me about constraints for framing design decisions: How might I re-examine the design choices of _Green Acres_ through new constraints? Could I improve the sustainability (and the sustainable aesthetics) for _Ecovention Europe_?</p><p>One of the items in De Bondt's printing manifesto is "use less ink." This meant selecting colors more carefully. The palette of _Ecovention Europe_ uses no color that adds up to more that 100% ink coverage. (_Ecovention Europe_ uses CMYK: and color palette swatches start at 100% pure C, M, Y, or K, and then are mixed in equal percentages to keep 100% or less total coverage: 50% + 50%; 33% + 33% + 33%; etc.). This resulted in a color palette that was fairly special for this book. Reducing ink also led to a graphic solution, bitmapped city aerial photos as the decorative section markers. The appearance of a filled area is kept, but less ink is used comparatively.</p><p>Text columns in _Green Acres_ ended at full paragraphs breaks to make editing easier. This gave a formally-nice rhythm to text columns, but it was an inefficient use of space. With _Ecovention Europe_, I reduced this space by running all the text the full column heights. This had the secondary benefit of minimizing superfluous decoration: In _Green Acres_, superficial decorative elements filled those blanks left by text columns ending mid-page.</p><p>I even tried to reduce decision making through reuse. The grid for _Green Acres_ had a lot of conceptual reasoning invested into it, and so I reused the page templates, type choices, grid setup, etc.</p><p>As a conceptual exercise, this was great. But, did it make much of a difference? How could this be done differently and improved upon again next time? Is there an alternative to making this book at all? (Should this exist? I didnâ€™t ask that question before we began!)
