<ol><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Radical%20Efficiency">Radical Efficiency</a>: This is the most important, far more so than Net Zero. The best way to achieve this is through the Passivhaus standard. Yes, air tightness is critical to it, but try it, you'll like it. As far as I am concerned, it should be the bare minimum standard if we are going to not fill that carbon bucket and break 1.5Â°.
</li><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Radical%20Sufficiency">Radical Sufficiency</a>: How much do you need? We have to build less stuff, extract fewer materials. We have to design the places we live and work so that we can get between them on foot or bike. But we also have to design them so that they are sufficiently resilient to adapt and protect us in changing conditions.
</li><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Radical%20Simplicity">Radical Simplicity</a>: Another reason for going Passive House. It's simple and doesn't need any fancy technology or robots. Just lots of insulation and really careful, simple detailing, careful assembly. It is the ultimate in low tech design, just sitting there, passively storing heat or keeping it out. There are a few fans and filters for fresh air, but that's it.</li><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Radical%20Decarbonization">Radical Decarbonization</a>: We have to build out of natural, renewable materials that store carbon, and minimize the upfront carbon emissions of everything we make or build. We also have to radically decarbonize our operating energy sources. We have to cut back on our use of fossil fuels to the point that the oil and gas companies are forced to leave it in the ground because there is so little demand. That means getting our homes off gas, and again, the best way to do that is Passivhaus.</li></ol>
