(7:51) When you are tackling climate change with a renewable energy solution WHAT ELSE are you also doing? The Co-benefits of restored habitats.</p><p>(8:20) What if in the name of farming electrons we put the natural habitats back</p><p>basically how can a solution generate power, but also increase biodiversity, restore water sheds, etc.!?</p><p>What benefits will come from tackling this problem? (10:20)</p><p>Likens to space race</p><p>there are a suite of options that are context dependent. local innovation, local solutions.</p><p>There are no one thing solutions</p><p>What gets you engaged in the solution? what gets you engaged with a community? Societal change at scale is what is most important... your individual actions can be a way in to a community, or asking for a governmental change?</p><p>A few people changing A LOT doesn't do much; a lot of people continuously changing A LITTLE is a great start.</p><p>(17:52) when you talk about solutions and common sense things, all the politics/partisan stuff melts away.</p>
