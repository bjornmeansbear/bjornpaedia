Food waste in developing places, the problem is on getting the food to people, in US, etc. its waste at the consumer level</p><p>meat based diets are worst</p><p>stop deforestation</p><p>improve agricultural practices on all the land we are already farming.</p><p>regenerative agriculture &gt; can also be sinks?</p><p>food solutions: <img class=" tc-image-loading" src="https://www.drawdown.org/sites/default/files/18_Unit_3_Food_Agriculture_and_Land_Use_Solutions.png"></p><h2 class="">Industry</h2><p>high temperative, energy intensive processes – steel, cement, chemicals, plastics...</p><p>plastic is more of an environmental problem, less a climate problem</p><p>most importantly, we just need to swap CFCs and HFCs for better refridgerants. </p><p><img class=" tc-image-loading" src="https://www.drawdown.org/sites/default/files/20_Unit_3_Industry_Solutions.png"></p><p>how is waste a better resource? instead of just waste?</p><h2 class="">Transporation</h2><p>10 of 14 is roads, 2% is flying... everything else — boats, trains, is 2%... so most importantly is reducing road mileage.</p><p>1 gallon of gas is 20lbs of CO2</p><p>Fuel efficiency... electric over gas... anything to reduce gas</p><p>even better, replace road transport with anything else that doesn't use fuel — bikes, walking, video conferencing, etc.</p><p><img class=" tc-image-loading" src="https://www.drawdown.org/sites/default/files/22_Unit_3_Transportation_Solutions.png"></p><h2 class="">Buildings</h2><p>Residential building use more, emit more than anything else. Hot water, boilers, furnaces. Leakage in AC and appliance refrigerants</p><p>heating in your building might be more than your car?</p><p>massive efficiency improvements required, non fossil fuel energy sources for everything... address refrigerants</p><p><img class=" tc-image-loading" src="https://www.drawdown.org/sites/default/files/key-graphics/24_Unit_3_Building_Solutions.png"></p><h2 class="">Other, Everything else...</h2><p>mostly flare off gas, leaking natural gas pipelines, etc. this is super low hanging fruit. </p><p>to wrap... <img class=" tc-image-loading" src="https://www.drawdown.org/sites/default/files/key-graphics/26_Unit_3_Sources_of_Greenhouse_Gases_Segmented_by_Sector.png"></p><h2 class="">To Do</h2><p>Start with efficiency, then switch to the low carbon or no carbon sources/ideas</p><p>plenty of options, plenty of opportunity, plenty of job creation and new business space</p>
