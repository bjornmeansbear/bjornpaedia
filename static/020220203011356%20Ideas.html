<p>And yet again, I'm here having problems.</p><p>Why am I such a failure? I couldn't get my grant app in, my internet crapped out and I ran out of time â€¦ why does everything get put off to the last minute? what can I do to change all of this? how is this project worth continuing? how does it get better? how does it help me do anything actually useful?</p><p>How much more work do I need to put into this thing to connect stuff together? to add more items? to break up complex bits into simpler, more reusable chunks? Am I trying to do too much here?</p>
