<p>okay, so I think to much about things.</p><p>I get and email or a task.</p><p>then I over think it. I write too much, I question if what I am saying is explained correctly or not, I rewrite, I add I subtract, I try to explain way toooooo much...
Then sometimes, that "did I write the right things" thinking sort of keeps me from just sending the email at all, or delays it so much its stupid.</p><p>The same for a phone call, I'm like afraid to not know what to say to someone on a phone call, or I forget to ask everything out of some weird paranoia/anxiety.</p><p>How do I get over this stuff? How do I think less!!!</p>
