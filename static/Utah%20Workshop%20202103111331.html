Visual research and intuitive making will lead to formal experiment, meaning making, and poster design. To start, please go through <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.drawdown.org/solutions" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Project Drawdown's Solutions</a> and find something that interests you.</p><p>You will conduct research on-line that will help inform this project. You may free-associate and/or stray from your original subject as you see fit. The goal is to reconsider our relationship to a thing or experience that once seemed familiar, and explore its application to design and culture at large.</p><hr><h2 class="">PART 1</h2><p>An experimental, expressive graphic exploration that responds to the source material: <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.drawdown.org/solutions" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Drawdown.org</a></p><ul><li>Slideshow with bibliography</li><li>20 experimental compositions, explore type only, image only and type and image combined</li></ul><p>(<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#WK1%20020210311151503%20Entry">WK1</a> &amp; <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Wk2%20020210311152234%20Entry">WK2</a>)</p><h2 class="">PART 2</h2><p>Two posters that create a dialogue about your topic and that challenge your audience to think critically.</p><ul><li>2 printed or animated posters, sized to your discretion. </li><li>Each poster must use:<ul><li>a grid</li><li>3 levels of hierarchy including a heading</li><li>200 words of text</li><li>at least one image. </li></ul></li></ul><p>What all of this means of course is up to you: the size, grid, etc. should all make sense based on your approach... how can you "make meaning" through selecting these design elements – not just through your text/image choices?</p><p>(<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#WK3%20020210311152542%20Entry">WK3</a> &amp; <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#WK4%20020210311152634%20Entry">WK4</a>)</p><hr><h3 class="">Assigned Mar 23, due Mar 30: </h3><h3 class="">Wk1</h3><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#What%20Is%20Research%3F">Research</a> &amp; <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="#Collection">Collection</a></p><p>Collect ideas and references from the reading; Collect visuals from recommended sources; Collect other information as needed.</p><p><em><strong>Deliverables</strong>: slideshow with bibliography of sources</em></p><ol><li>Read Through <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.drawdown.org/solutions" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Project Drawdown</a>'s table of solutions.<ul><li>Choose a solution that interests you.<ul><li>Skim across the solutions, and once you pick one that interests you, please read your chosen section carefully.</li><li>What else can you then go and find about this solution? <ul><li>where is it done? who is doing it? is this pragmatic today? what new opportunities does this create? what changes in society/culture are required? what new thinking is necessary? what does this extend or enhance? what else does this amputate or deprecate?</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Create a typology study:<ul><li>Make a list of 10 key words that describe your solution, or that you find otherwise important or related.</li><li>Find 3 <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#aphorism">aphorism</a>s or quotes that describe something about the solution beyond what's on <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Project%20Drawdown">Project Drawdown</a>'s site.</li><li>Look at <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Poster%20Workshop%20Image%20Resources">free/libre/opensource/creative commons/public domain resources</a> and collect images, illustrations, diagrams, patterns, etc that you think can illustrate the chosen solution.<ul><li>What literal objects represent your solution?</li><li>What metaphors apply to your solution?</li><li>What possible allusions can you make in design, art, architecture, literature, history, anthropology, economics, etc, to your solution?</li><li>What personal influences and interests would you like to combine with your solution?</li></ul></li><li>Present your research and typology collections as a PDF slide show. <ul><li>To Include: your drawdown solution selection, your words, your found aphorisms or quotes, and your image research.</li><li>The last page should be a bibliography of your sources.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ol><hr><h3 class="">Assigned Mar 30, due April 6: </h3><h3 class="">Wk2</h3><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="#Formal%20experimentation">Formal experimentation</a></p><p>An experimental, expressive graphic exploration that responds to and expands on your selected </p><ol><li>Based on your research and collecting from WK1, please create 20 experimental compositions<ul><li>Make 20 square collages using whatever tools work for you.</li><li>Explore the form-making potential of the words, aphorisms, and images you have gathered by manipulating type and image.</li><li>Consider both analog and digital manipulation of letterforms and images.<ul><li>How does the meaning of words change if you use a different typeface?</li><li>How do the compositions communicate your specific interpretation of the topic?</li><li>How can you use type and image to communicate spatial relationships and environments?
