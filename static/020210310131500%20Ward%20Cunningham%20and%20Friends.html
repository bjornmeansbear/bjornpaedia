<p><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Ward%20Cunningham">Ward Cunningham</a> and friends deliberately stripped the wiki of many features that were considered integral to document collaboration in the past. Instead of attributing each change of the document to a certain person, they removed much of the visual representation of ownership. They made the content ego-less and time-less. They decided it wasnâ€™t important who wrote the content or when it was written. And that has made all the difference. This decision fostered a shared sense of community and was a key ingredient in the success of Wikipedia.</p>
