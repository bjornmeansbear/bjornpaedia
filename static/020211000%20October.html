<p>Month five of the idea. September was a pretty low output month, and now its looking like October will be/is too... working on some other projects, and dealing with a general depression/malaise/lost feeling... trying to do some house stuff, working on up to date HVAC that should use WAY less energy long term AND be better heating/coiking wise. Also hoping to insulate the attic in a serious way. otherwise... watched too many shows on netflix, etc. and time just disappeared. Here's to getting back to things.</p><p>
