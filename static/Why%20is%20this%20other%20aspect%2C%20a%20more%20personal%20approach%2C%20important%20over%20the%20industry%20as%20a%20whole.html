In this context, that is what I am referring to: the power of design to make more clear, more understandable, more impactful one's actions or ideologies. </p><p>I would prefer that this is what students take away from design schooling: Design is a medium for self-expression and intellectual inquiry. The same things you might learn in a design classroom around how to, based on your contexts, your way of seeing or experiencing the world, can still be turned onto industry at large, sure.
