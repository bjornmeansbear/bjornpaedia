<p>I am trying to figure out how to show some links to and from things on these tiddlers, but when empty nothing shows...</p><p>I am also trying to figure out how to build a cool dynamic list of all the prompts I've used, so far that is a bust too.</p><p>I also wish to point out that "<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Signs%20Signaling%20Sustainability">signs signaling sustainability</a>" could be a direction to take some of this web stuff too? does that become its own prompt? how to explain everything as a potential SSS!?</p><p>How do I preset journals to have the requisite fields for my rambling writings?? is there a way to standardize the answers?</p><p>this wasn't really a writing day as much as a figure out some cool tiddlywiki things â€“ is that getting in the way now of actually trying to write anything! ugh. Always the procrastinator</p>
