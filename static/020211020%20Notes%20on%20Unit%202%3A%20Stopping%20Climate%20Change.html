(≈ 6:00)</p><p>Where do the gases come from? (≈6:14)</p><p>GHGs are mainly coming from burning fossil fuels, CO2 from fossil fuels is 60% of GHGs... but we do some industrial chemistry, we burn forests, then we have a lot of methane from agriculture, and then industry... then there's a bit of Nitrous Oxide &gt; too much fertilizer! and then Fluorinated gases... there is a chart (≈6:14–9:00)</p><p><img class=" tc-image-loading" src="https://www.drawdown.org/sites/default/files/12_Unit_2_Global_Greenhouse_Gases.png"></p><p>Each gas works differently</p><p>Methane and flourinated gases trap more than CO2, but then methane breaks down to CO2 fast... </p><p>Source vs. Sink</p><p>Sources add, sinks remove.</p><p>If the sink is bigger than the source then our GHG levels will go down!!!</p><p>Pull the GHGs out of the atmosphere and put them somewhere else... Mainly Forests and Oceans.</p><p>Todays Atmostphere: ≈13:15</p><p><img class=" tc-image-loading" src="https://www.drawdown.org/sites/default/files/13_Unit_2_Greenhouse_Gas_Sources_and_Natural_Sinks.png"></p><p>6 major sources of GHG pollution</p><p>we have only 2 major sources of natural sinks.</p><p>We need to bring the sources down, and then we need to support the natural sinks, as well as add some new kinds of sinks.</p><p>Three main principles for stopping climate change:</p><ol><li>Reduce Sources: stop pollution before it even gets to the atmosphere</li><li>Support Sinks: look at the land and oceans, how can we support or augment their ability to absorb carbon</li><li>Improving Society: by building a more just, equitable society, we actually help reduce sources and create sinks... ?</li></ol>
