<p>So doing these things in different ways, it IS important. It shows another way forward, or potentially MANY other ways forward. If we go back to this future speculation diagram, (show the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#FutureCone">FutureCone</a>), then we see that as potential futures spread out, if we start aiming way outside of the probable, way further out into possible, or even impossible, we start to affect WHAT IS POSSIBLE. So, thinking through these things in whatever utopian lenses you have HELPS everyone else... ??? </p>
