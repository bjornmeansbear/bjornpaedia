<p>What comes to mind when you read the phrase “sustainable graphic design?” Is there a particular aesthetic? Is there a particular kind of client? Is there a particular visual trope or particular look or feel? How about a particular message? Do you just picture “<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#The%20Triple%20Bottom%20Line">the triple bottom line</a>?” Is it environmentally friendly? recycled paper? What?</p>
