He lives in Baltimore, MD with his wife and two children in an old stone house they're trying to make energy efficient. He's made biodiesel, helped his wife run a vegetable farm, and is now converting his family's small yard into an orchard.

Whatever the output, Kristian sees every project as an opportunity to create signs signaling sustainability. Kristian holds an MFA in Graphic Design from MICA and a BA in Studio Art from Kalamazoo College.
