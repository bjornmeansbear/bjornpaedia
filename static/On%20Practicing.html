<p>A good teacher helps students realize that simply having access to tools does not result in expertise. Understanding a tool takes patience, time, and practice. We must practice using software, seeing accurate form, and crafting ideas just like we had to practice drawing, bicycling, or piano playing. This takes time. The process is frustrating. A good teacher integrates practice as part of applying a tool to a larger idea, not just practicing the tool itself (facilitating understanding over mere learning). Students should be encouraged to spend time outside of class practicing their making and practicing their thinking with new and different tools. Explorations following that encouragement may lead to less-than aesthetically wonderful results. This is not failure. Not everything need end with perfect, precise materials.</p>
