<p>A concept that was never made due to some weird problems; but that sent me down this direction: The Copenhagen waste to energy plant is so clean its exhaust stack puffs only CO2 and water vapor. (Its also a public ski hill and hiking mountain) Upon capturing 1 ton of CO2, exhausts it as a smoke ring. Help you visualize this otherwise intangible aspect of sustainability!?
