<p>A traditional <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="#Petroleum%20Diesel">Petroleum Diesel</a> equivalent made from plant and animal oil sources. Frequently made from Soy, Canola, and other commerical vegetable oils. Can be made from waste oil as well. </p><p>I don't completely remember the science, but you take oils, you start with triglycerides, and through transesterification – mixing with alcohol in some steps – end up with long-chain fatty acid esters; this is the biodiesel... and glycerin as the "waste"? something like that... </p>
