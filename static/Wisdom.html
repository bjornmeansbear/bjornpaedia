<pre><code>I do not know 
What wisdom is—
But if I knew,
It might be a blue shadow
Where some dumb thing
That never weeps
Creeps away to die.
I do not know
What wisdom is—
But if I knew
It might be a blue shadow.
Wisdom might be trees.</code></pre><p>How does this connect with <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Wisdom%20is%20a%20very%20beautiful%20word">Wisdom is a very beautiful word</a>? or <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Becoming%20Wise%20with%20Krista%20Tippett">Becoming Wise with Krista Tippett</a>??</p>
