<p>a cross-reference book of information on some esthetic boundaries: consisting of a bibliography into which are inserted a fragmented text, art works, documents, interviews, and symposia, arranged chronologically and focused on so-called conceptual or information or idea art with mentions of such vaguely designated areas as minimalism, anti-form, systems, earth, or process art, occurring now in the Americas, Europe, England, Australia, and Asia (with occasional political overtones), edited and annotated by <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Lucy%20R.%20Lippard">Lucy R. Lippard</a></p><p>NOTES:</p><p>Conceptual art means work in which the idea is paramount and the material form is secondary, lightweight, ephemeral, cheap, unpretentious, and/or "dematerialized" (pg vii, ¶3, L1)</p><p>The times were chaotic and so were our lies. We have each invented our own history, and they don't always mesh; but such messy compost is the source of all version of the past. (pg vii, ¶5, L1)</p>
