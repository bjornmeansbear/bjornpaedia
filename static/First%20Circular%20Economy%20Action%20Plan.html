The EU’s transition to a circular economy is now guided by the new circular economy action plan.</p><p>In 2015, the European Commission adopted its first circular economy action plan. It included measures to help stimulate Europe's transition towards a circular economy, boost global competitiveness, foster sustainable economic growth and generate new jobs.</p><p>The action plan established concrete and ambitious actions, with measures covering the whole life cycle: from production and consumption to waste management and the market for secondary raw materials and a revised legislative proposal on waste.</p><p>On 4 March 2019, the European Commission adopted a comprehensive report on the implementation of the action plan. The report presents the main achievements and sketches out future challenges to shaping our economy and paving the way towards a climate-neutral, circular economy where pressure on natural and freshwater resources as well as ecosystems is minimised.</p>
