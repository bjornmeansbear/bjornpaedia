<p>When will I ever have time to read books again???</p><p>When will I ever have time to bake bread again??? what about all our other cooking and fermenting projects?</p><p>Why is having this carefully planned yard so important? why bother? does it show anyone another way forward? does it DO anything? Is there a way to make it do more!? Is it about the welfare of ALL the OTHER LIFE around here? not mine or my neighbors, but the cardinal's or the dobson fly's?</p><p>Why is this such a struggle?</p><p>What are these characters I play? the sustainabilitist? the libre designer? how do I embody them more? how do I act more unselfconciously? how do I act!? I mean act as in actually go out and do something. I have "done something" man, in, years? I talk a lot about doing things, I tell other people to do things? I plan vaguely about doing things... but nothing really gets done!?</p><p>I don't even know what day it is anymore.</p><p>What is my <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Traditional%20Ecological%20Knowledge">Traditional Ecological Knowledge</a> – who has some in Balitmore!? what can I learn, listen to, participate in. Not to "improve" myself but to better help others? to better serve others? to better help the local biome?</p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="#Piedmont%20Forest">Piedmont Forest</a></p><p>How does my yard help a hellbender salamander? how does it help a heron? how does it help the peregrine falcons up the road? how does it help the neighborhood bunnies? how does it help the neighbors?</p><p>Is this part of the issue – if you ask "how does what I am doing help X" and "X" isn't "make me more money" in some shape or form, then no wonder it seems weird to do ????????</p><p>what do I mean here, I mean... well, like whats the cheapest, simplest way to update this house. None of the things I am trying to do really fall into that. Whtas the best return on investment, again probably not the things I am hoping to do... Our yard projects don't fall into this, theyre probably a detriment.</p><p>How does one find tax breaks or grants or anything else for the kinds of things we are trying to do!?</p>
