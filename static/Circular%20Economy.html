</p></blockquote><p>The economy can be defined as the careful management of the wealth and resources of a community. The traditional <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Linear%20Economy">Linear Economy</a> of "<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Take%2C%20Make%2C%20Waste">Take, Make, Waste</a>" is reaching its limits by relying on enormous quantities of easily accessible cheap energy and materials. The current <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="#supply%20chain">supply chain</a> follows the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#The%203Rs">reduce, reuse, recycle</a> concept, but this is still a <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="#waste%20hierarchy">waste hierarchy</a> relying on <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="#finite%20resources">finite resources</a> and the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="#ecosystem">ecosystem’s</a> limited ability to breakdown <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="#waste">wastes</a>.</p><p>The idea of a <em>circular economy</em> aims for the sustainable use and protection of material resource efficiencies by engineering everything to be continuously reused or recycled. Every aspect of design, manufacturing, retail, reusing, and recycling would require rethinking to be <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="#restorative">restorative</a> and <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="#regenerative">regenerative</a> by design. With the massive amounts of waste from irresponsible manufacturing, disposable lifestyles, volatile prices, ad increasing geopolitical tensions with the scarcity of resources, a <em>circular economy</em> can help stabilize these problems by decoupling economic growth from natural resource consumption. There would be tremendous economic advantages for businesses adopting the <em>circular economy</em> concept, as well as transitioning to renewable energies as indicated by economist Jeremy Rifkin. </p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="#The%20Ellen%20MacArthur%20Foundation">The Ellen MacArthur Foundation</a> (2013), in <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="#Towards%20the%20Circular%20Economy">Towards the Circular Economy</a>, lists three driving principles of a <em>circular economy</em>: <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="#the%20preservation%20and%20enhancement%20of%20natural%20capital">the preservation and enhancement of natural capital</a>, <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="#the%20optimization%20of%20resource%20yields">the optimization of resource yields</a>, and <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="#the%20fostering%20of%20system%20effectiveness">the fostering of system effectiveness</a>. In enhancing natural capital, finite sources and renewable resource flows need to be controlled by dematerializing what we use. Extending product life can optimize resource yields, and improve reuse by always keeping the highest quality of product usefulness. </p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Recycle">Recycling</a> is a limited solution, as remanufacturing is energy intensive and results in products that are downgraded from their original quality, leading to the continuing demand for virgin resources. In an ideal <em>circular economy</em> wastes and toxins would be designed out of the system, allowing materials to be used over and over with high quality.</p><p>The European Union adopted a <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#First%20Circular%20Economy%20Action%20Plan">circular economy package in December 2015</a> setting challenging waste targets of bans on sending wood, plastics, textiles, and food to landfills. The goal is to generate the maximum value and use from all the raw materials, products, and waste, creating energy savings and thereby reducing <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#greenhouse%20gas">greenhouse gas</a> emissions. <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="#The%20German%20Resource%20Efficiency%20Program%20%28ProgRess%29">The German Resource Efficiency Program (ProgRess)</a> and <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="#Toronto%27s%20Tool%20Library">Toronto's Tool Library</a>, as well as the progressive materials assessment standards, such as <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Cradle%20to%20Cradle">Cradle to Cradle</a> and the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="#Living%20Product%20Challenge">Living Product Challenge</a> are all examples of innovative resource rethinking.</p><p>The <em>circular economy</em> comes down to matching existing material waste streams with new applications. Sharing information, optimizing resource use, close-looping, and exchanging both materials and information will be needed for industries to reduce the environmental damage from natural resource extractions. </p><p>See Also:</p><ul><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Closed-Loop">Closed-Loop</a> </li><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Cradle%20to%20Cradle">Cradle to Cradle</a></li><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="#Green%20Economy">Green Economy</a></li><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="#Materials%20and%20Resources">Materials and Resources</a></li></ul><p>Further Sources:</p><ul><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="#The%20Ellen%20MacArthur%20Foundation">The Ellen MacArthur Foundation</a></li><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="#GreenBiz">GreenBiz</a></li><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="#Zbicinski%2C%20et%20al.">Zbicinski, et al.</a> (2006)</li></ul>
