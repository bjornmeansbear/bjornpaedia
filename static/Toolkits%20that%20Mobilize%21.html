<p>I found this series of questions/prompts in a pile of paper. Not sure where they came from:</p><ol><li>How did writing about the project inform the design?</li><li>What is the call to action? Is it BOLD? Consider the context of the issue, what might bold mean for your issue?</li><li>How does the designer invite participation? what visual language or material cues do they give the use of the toolkit?</li><li>If you were to add another digital or physical tool to the kit, what would it be?</li><li>How would the toolkit be distributed or shared? online? at an event? on a bulletin board? </li></ol>
