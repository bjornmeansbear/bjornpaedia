<p>An amazing tool for writing, creating, interlinking, and ideating. It is what is currently powering this Knowledge Garden.</p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>TiddlyWiki is a rich, interactive tool for manipulating complex data with structure that doesn't easily fit into conventional tools like spreadsheets or wordprocessors.</p><p>TiddlyWiki is designed to fit around your brain, helping you deal with the things that won't fit. The <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Philosophy%2520of%2520Tiddlers.html">fundamental idea</a> is that information is more useful and reusable if we cut it up into the smallest semantically meaningful chunks – <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Tiddlers.html">tiddlers</a> – and give them titles so that they can be <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Structuring%2520TiddlyWiki.html">structured</a> with <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="TiddlerLinks.html">links</a>, <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Tagging.html">tags</a>, <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="ListField.html">lists</a> and <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Macros.html">macros</a>. Tiddlers use a <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="WikiText.html">WikiText</a> notation that concisely represents a wide range of text formatting and hypertext features. TiddlyWiki aims to provide a fluid interface for working with tiddlers, allowing them to be aggregated and composed into longer narratives.</p><p>People love using TiddlyWiki. Because it can be used without any complicated server infrastructure, and because it is <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="OpenSource.html">open source</a>, it has brought unprecedented freedom to everyone to keep their precious information under their own control.</p><p>TiddlyWiki was originally created by <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="JeremyRuston.html">JeremyRuston</a> and is now a thriving <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="License.html">open source</a> project with a busy <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Community.html">Community</a> of independent developers.
