(From Sterling's essay <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#The%20Last%20Viridian%20Note">The Last Viridian Note</a>)</p><ol><li>Beautiful Things</li><li>Sentimental Things</li><li>Utilitarian Things</li><li>Everything else.</li></ol><p>Categories 1–3 are worth keeping, category 4 is to be discarded.</p><p>When de Botton talks about beauty in design and architecture, his “beauty” encompasses Sterling’s top 3 categories.</p><p>But, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Sterling found the need to break his list of criteria four separate entities, and not just “beautiful things” and “everything else.” I find a well crafted hammer functional, utilitarian, and beautiful. To another, it might just be functional. The paintings and drawings I find beautiful are what another might find ugly. The things I find sentimental are unique to me. Not everyone has the same idea of what should be sustained as not everyone thinks the same things are beautiful.</p>
