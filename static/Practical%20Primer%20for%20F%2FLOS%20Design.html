<p>or, Why <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Free%20Culture">Free Culture</a> makes sense (cents?)</p><p>Utilizing free — free as in freedom — resources as a designer has a number of immediate practical implications.</p><ol><li>you can (for the most part) get images, fonts, tools, etc. for NO cost.</li><li>you can share and redistribute the resources you use with your colleagues, clients, friends, students, etc. with no retribution or legal ramifications.</li><li>you can use and remix and modify and tweak to your hearts (and designs) content; again with far fewer limitations or EULAs or production limits.</li></ol><p>There are however differences in the “free-ness” or liberated ness or open ness of works of cultural production. There is the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Public%20Domain">Public Domain</a> — and so these things are useable by anyone for anything and you need not even ask for permission or credit the works. Then there are the various kinds of <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Creative%20Commons">Creative Commons</a> licenses (<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="#CC0">CC0</a> = <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Public%20Domain">Public Domain</a>); there is also the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="#Free%20Art%20License">Free Art License</a>, and there are also various software licenses that in different degrees might also apply to creative art and design works (for example, <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="#OFL">OFL</a> applies to typefaces, though you could also use <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#GPL">GPL</a> or <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="#Apache">Apache</a> or <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="#MIT">MIT</a> for typefaces, as they are really computer files/programs).</p><p>Free (No cost/Gratis) as useful side effect of Free (Freedom/Libre) cultural works: </p><p>If you are working for say, a non-profit cultural organization, you might need to budget concious — maybe they can't afford a typeface license for a ton of computers, or at all; maybe they have no photo/art budget; maybe you want to do something else cool that requires money for printing/production, and so need to save on tools and images and new type — This is another place "free" comes in!? And it can even be a selling point for what you want to do.</p><p>so, <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="#Why%20don%27t%20designers%20open%20source%3F">Why don't designers open source?</a></p>
