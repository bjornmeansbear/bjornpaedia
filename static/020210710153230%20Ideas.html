<p>how to get rid of automobiles? What is the point of "personal" mobility? why should something like a car be an individually owned conveyance? why can't we see how useful collectively owning a fleet of robot cars could be? why not no cars? What is the advantage of a car? why cars? who benefits from me owning a car? how might we maximize that benefit to more people? does this network of roads do aything useful? do more roads make us better as a people or worse? what if you couldn't just hopin your car and drive whereeer you wanted? what would you do then?</p><p>Why am I so against cars these days? I used to like cars so much.</p>
