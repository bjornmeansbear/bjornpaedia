</p></blockquote><p>We live in a throwaway economy in which finite resources are being wasted. More and more resources are being extracted from the Earth's crust, while requiring more and more energy in the production, processing, manufacturing, transportation, and disposing of these materials. Buckminster referred to not harvesting our valuable and wasted resources as a type of pollution. Our products purchased are just the tip of a vast pile of extracted resources, carbon-emitting fuel, and toxic wastes, and are often the products of unfair labor practices. </p><p>The potential for reducing material use in modern industrial economies by using only one-fourth of the virgin raw materials and still functioning very efficiently was recognized in Germany in the 1990s by <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="#Schmidt-Bleek">Schmidt-Bleek</a> and <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="#von%20Weizs%C3%A4cker">von Weizsäcker</a>, who called this potential resource reduction <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Factor%204">Factor 4</a>.</p><p>Material use reduction begins with recycling, which also generates tremendous energy savings, reduces carbon emissions, reduces air and water pollution, and slashes the size of our growing landfills. The steel discarded each year is enough to meet the needs of the U.S. auto industry. Steel made from recycled scrap metal takes only 26% as much energy as that from iron ore. A recycled aluminum can saves 95% of the energy of making a new can. Steel and aluminum can be recycled indefinitely (provided impurities are kept to a minimum). Recycled plastic uses only 20% of the energy, and recycled paper uses only 64% as much energy and far fewer chemicals for processing (Brown 2009, p.98).</p><p>Conventional product designs have limited reusability, and are called <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="#cradle%20to%20grave">cradle to grave</a> products (AKA <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Take%2C%20Make%2C%20Waste">Take, Make, Waste</a> or <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Linear%20Economy">Linear Economy</a>).  Product systems need to be designed as nature-mimicking to support reuse in regenerative products and services much like nature's larger system where all materials are nutrients in nature's processes. <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#William%20McDonough">McDonough</a> and Braungart conclude that waste and pollution need to be avoided entirely and everything we own should be recycled, remade, or buried in the ground to compost.
