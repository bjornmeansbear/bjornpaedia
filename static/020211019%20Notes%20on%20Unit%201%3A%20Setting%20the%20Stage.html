(3:55)</p><p>70% of H2O we "use" is used for irrigation</p><p>These are obvious, seeable changes.</p><p>Atmospheric changes are way more invisible, more subtle.</p><p>Greenhouse gases are higher than at anytime of human history (not planetary history... but yeah, in terms of what humans have experienced its the warmest)</p><p>"The great acceleration" – All since the 50s?</p><p>Climate change is the biggest things - our use of energy, land, resources, etc. lead to this...</p><p>If you are already having a hard time, its gonna be way harder.</p><p>Burden is on future generations.</p><p>Could be hopeless...
