Phone or car more valuable as functioning phone or car, not its components. How to share, how to get more uses out of it, resale, etc. Next best is remanufacture, introduce the fewest possible NEW components, keep it mostly the same, keep most of use value. Recycling is last resort.</p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#The%203Rs">The 3Rs</a></p><p>Biological: By composting or anaerobically digesting organic materials, valuable nutrients, such as nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium, and micronutrients, can be used to help regenerate the land. Some products, like cotton clothing or wooden furniture, can be circulated through both the technical and biological cycle. They can be maintained, reused, repaired, and sometimes even recycled, but eventually they can be returned to the biological cycle from which they came</p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Cradle%20to%20Cradle">Cradle to Cradle</a> goes into a lot of detail on these things</p><p>Design with proper circulation in mind.</p><p>Many products designed that combine these nutrient types</p><p>keep finite materials in the economy and out of the environment; return biodegradable materials to the earth</p>
