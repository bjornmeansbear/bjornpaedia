<p>Month two of the idea. The goal for this month is to find a few more coherent <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Prompts">Prompts</a> that maybe all come from my previous writings and ideas so I can expand on something that's already started? clarify something I've already been thinking about? how to generate a lot of coherent content that can then start to be put into some kinds of forms!?</p><p>
