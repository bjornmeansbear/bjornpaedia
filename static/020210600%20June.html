<p>Okay, I am going to do something here again everyday. I am going to find random things in my <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Are.na%20Channels%20w%2F%20potential%20Prompts">are.na sustainability and design channels</a>, things that can work like <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Prompts">prompts</a>. I'll then write several words on that <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Prompt">prompt</a>… not sure if I set a word limit, or a time limit. We'll see how the first couple of days/weeks go. March, April, and May were real rough — hopefully things go better moving forward!</p><p>
