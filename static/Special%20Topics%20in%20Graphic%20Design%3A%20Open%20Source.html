<p><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Special%20Topics%20in%20Graphic%20Design%3A%20Open%20Source">Special Topics in Graphic Design: Open Source</a> ran from January to May of 2018 at the Maryland Institute College of Art (MICA). The course asked students to explore F/LOS software and ideologies in producing graphic design. Other than “earnestly experiment with F/LOS tools,” the main projects were working with the MICA library on an identity and print materials, and collaboratively writing, designing, and printing a book that was exemplary of and about our F/LOS exercises and experiments. Each week we discussed how F/LOS’s ideas and technologies might serve the students’ (and the greater design communities) needs better than mainstream offerings.</p><p>Three lectures and workshops at MICA inspired the class’ origins. <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Loraine%20Furter">Loraine Furter</a> and <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Eric%20Schrijver">Eric Schrijver</a>, members of a collective known as “<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Open%20Source%20Publishing">Open Source Publishing</a>,”  ran two workshops: one using public domain resources in one’s design practice, and one customizing open source fonts. <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="#David%20Crossland">David Crossland</a> of Google Fonts visited MICA and demoed new open source variable typefaces that Google and Type Network ,  collaborated on. Ending his lecture, Crossland explained how he ended up working at Google Fonts in the first place: being a lover and supporter of F/LOS. With Furter and Schrijver’s examples for how design practice might embrace F/LOS, and through casual conversation with Crossland about his libre font and software background, F/LOS ideals and tools felt like good exploratory territory for a graphic design course.</p>
