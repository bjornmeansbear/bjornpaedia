<p>It is morning. I am waiting.</p><p>Waiting on a project; waiting for myself to get motivated.</p><p>I can always seem to find a way to stay focused, to figure out what to do next. Everything is a reaction. Is that natural. Do trees plan; is everything intentional; are they reacting to their environment continuously?</p><p>Is there a better job I could be doing? is RUNNING a graphic design business not the right thing, is just doing other peoples tasks/projects what I should be doing instead?</p><p>These construction guys look like they're having a good time. They get to be outside, build real stuff. Help people a little some of the time; not with made up things – like a website for invented objects just to be sold – but people who's wall is caving in or house is leaking. That's real right?</p><p>What is this obsession with real? is this really a question of "value" like what do I find valuable? Perhaps I need to read <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Zen%20and%20the%20Art%20of%20Motorcycle%20Maintenance">Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</a> again?</p>
