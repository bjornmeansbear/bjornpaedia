<p>Why are we still on AC power? will our houses start to have a DC and AC breaker box? basically lights and technology are all just DC things now, and we have to convert the power, sometimes several times, to usable DC feeds for our different devices. Same goes with solar arrays, we have to convert them to AC from DC and then back again sometimes multiple times. WHAT ARE WE DOING?</p><p>This is a cool <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="#Design%20Fiction">Design Fiction</a> prompt.</p>
