# bjornpaedia

live web version of the stuff I am working on over in https://github.com/bjornmeansbear/sentence-a-day

Like wikipedia; but it is just my personal collection of stuff relating to sustainability, free/libre open source, designing, and other flights of fancy part of some train of thought.

Enjoy.
